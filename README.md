# Airplane Seating Algorithm UI

Made using ReactJS, this UI is supposed to display how the passengers will be seated on an airplane, based on a special algorithm, which states:
```
The seats will be filled from top to bottom, left to right.

The aisle seats will be filled up first.
The window seats will be filled up second.
The middle seats will be filled up last.
```

The app is supposed to take input from user, such as the number of passengers, along with the seat grid dimensions.

These values will be then passed on to the API, which will return the seating arrangement. The arrangement will be displayed in the UI. 

The backend code can be found on: https://github.com/DinoWithCurls/airplane-seating-api
